I didn't find any bug. 

Summary

I started the problem by first reading the input data from a file, where the first value gives the number of elements to be sorted. Then, based on the user’s choice, I implemented five sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and System Sort.

For Bubble Sort, I made it so that it repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This keeps going until no more swaps are needed. 

For Merge Sort, I divided the array into smaller subarrays, sorted them individually, and then merged them back in sorted order. 

For Heap Sort, I built a array which respects to heap property and repeatedly extracted the smallest element from the heap and put it into the sorted array. 

For System Sort, I just used the built-in sort from C++’s standard library (std::sort).

After implementing all these algorithms, I added an option to print the sorted array if the user wanted. I also made sure to measure the execution time for each algorithm to see how they compare in performance across different input sizes.

I also attached two graphs with this file. :)
